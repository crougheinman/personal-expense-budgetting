## Updated Data Models

### Enhanced `Expense` Interface
```typescript
export interface Expense {
  // ... existing fields
  receiptData?: ReceiptData;  // NEW: Receipt information
}

export interface ReceiptData {
  imageUrl?: string;           // Receipt image URL
  originalText?: string;       // Raw OCR text
  extractedData?: {           // Parsed data
    merchantName?: string;
    total?: number;
    date?: Date;
    items?: ReceiptItem[];
  };
  confidence?: number;         // OCR confidence
  processedAt?: Date;         // Processing timestamp
}
```

## How to Use

### 1. **Access Receipt Scanning**
- Navigate to Expenses ‚Üí Add Expense
- Click the "Scan Receipt" button
- Choose "Take Photo" (camera) or "Upload Image" (file)

### 2. **Camera Capture**
- Grant camera permissions when prompted
- Point camera at receipt
- Tap the camera button to capture
- Review the captured image

### 3. **File Upload**
- Click "Choose File"
- Select a receipt image (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- Maximum file size: 10MB

### 4. **OCR Processing**
- Image is automatically processed with OCR
- Progress indicator shows processing status
- Extracted data is displayed for review

### 5. **Form Auto-Fill**
- Expense form is automatically populated with:
  - Merchant name ‚Üí Expense name
  - Total amount ‚Üí Amount field
  - Receipt date ‚Üí Expense date
  - Suggested category based on merchant
  - OCR text ‚Üí Notes field

### 6. **Review and Save**
- Verify auto-filled data
- Make manual adjustments if needed
- Save the expense with receipt data

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "tesseract.js": "^5.x.x",    // OCR engine
  "html2canvas": "^1.x.x"      // Image utilities
}
```

### Key Features

#### Smart Category Detection
The system intelligently suggests expense categories based on merchant names:
- "McDonald's" ‚Üí Food
- "Shell Gas Station" ‚Üí Transport  
- "CVS Pharmacy" ‚Üí Health
- "Amazon" ‚Üí Shopping
- "AMC Theater" ‚Üí Entertainment

#### OCR Text Parsing
Advanced text parsing extracts:
- **Merchant**: First meaningful line (not dates/amounts)
- **Total**: Looks for "Total", "Amount", largest monetary value
- **Date**: Multiple date format recognition
- **Items**: Line items with prices

#### Error Handling
- Camera permission errors
- File validation (type, size)
- OCR processing failures
- Graceful fallbacks

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Receipt Storage**: Upload images to Firebase Storage
2. **Machine Learning**: Improve extraction accuracy over time
3. **Expense Templates**: Save common merchants as templates
4. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple receipts at once
5. **Export Integration**: Include receipts in expense reports

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Image Compression**: Reduce file sizes before OCR
2. **Worker Threads**: Move OCR processing to web workers
3. **Caching**: Cache OCR results for repeated images
4. **Progressive Loading**: Stream OCR results as they're processed

## Browser Compatibility

### Camera Access
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support  
- **Safari**: iOS 11+ required
- **Mobile Browsers**: Works on HTTPS only

### OCR Processing
- **Modern Browsers**: Full Tesseract.js support
- **Older Browsers**: Graceful degradation to manual entry

## Security Considerations

### Privacy
- **Local Processing**: OCR runs entirely in browser
- **No Cloud Upload**: Receipt images stay on device (unless explicitly saved)
- **User Control**: Users can review/edit all extracted data

### Permissions
- **Camera Access**: Only requested when needed
- **File Access**: Standard browser file picker
- **Storage**: Receipt data saved to user's Firebase account only

## Testing the Feature

### 1. **Test with Sample Receipts**
- Use clear, well-lit receipt images
- Try different receipt types (restaurants, gas stations, stores)
- Test various image qualities and orientations

### 2. **Camera Testing**
- Test on different devices (desktop, mobile, tablet)
- Verify camera switching (front/back on mobile)
- Test in different lighting conditions

### 3. **Error Scenarios**
- Deny camera permissions
- Upload invalid file types
- Test with blurry/unclear images
- Network connectivity issues

## Getting Started

The receipt scanning feature is now integrated into your expense tracking app. To use it:

1. **Build the Project**: `npm run build`
2. **Start Development**: `npm start`
3. **Navigate to Expenses**: Go to the expenses page
4. **Click "Add Expense"**: The enhanced form will open
5. **Try "Scan Receipt"**: Test the new functionality

The feature enhances your existing workflow while maintaining backward compatibility with manual expense entry.
